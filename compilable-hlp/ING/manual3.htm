		<h4><font color="#006600">Command editor</font></h4>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><FONT size="1">A command is simply an "alias" for a key combination like Shift + F1, 
				Alt + A , Z , etc. This is used because a game (specially simulators) can have 
				many key combinations and it is easier to manage command names than key 
				combinations.</FONT></p>
		<p><FONT size="1">In the command editor window you can see a list with two columns, one 
				with the command names and another with the keys asociated to the commands.</FONT></p>
		<p><FONT size="1"> There are also four buttons in the window. With the first three you 
				can <b>Add</b>, <b>Edit</b> or <b>Delete</b> a command and with <b>Add Mouse</b>
				you can add mouse emulation to the joystick.</FONT></p>
		<p><FONT size="1">If you click on <b>Add</b> or <b>Edit</b> you´ll see a new screen 
				(the <a href="manual4.htm">Command window</a>) to configure the commands and 
				the keys they have asociated.</FONT></p>
		<p><FONT size="1"> The fourth button ( <b>Add mouse</b> ) adds six special commands 
				without keys. These commands represents the mouse movements and the left and 
				right mouse buttons.<br>
				Once added these commands can be used to emulate the mouse with joystick 
				buttons. The commands&nbsp;work as the normal commands but they cannot be 
				edited.</FONT></p>
