## Description
The X36 NT Driver is a tool to program Saitek X36 and X35 joysticks (gameport ones, no USB ) in Windows 2000 and XP operating systems.

The tool is divided in two parts :

- A keyboard filter driver to make the joystick programmable.
- A program (X36Map) to load and edit the keystrokes to be sent to the joystick.

The X36 NT Driver can program the X36F joystick alone or in combination with the X35 (X36F + X35T ; X36F + X35F) . The driver cannot program the X35T alone and it is not tested on the X35F alone.
